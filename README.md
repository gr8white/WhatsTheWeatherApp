# WhatsTheWeatherApp
Simple iOS app that scrapes a website and returns a 3-day forecast for the city that the user has submitted.

## Getting Started

'What's the Wather' is the first app that I built that is based upon scraping the internet for a set of information based on what the user inputs and returning their individual results. I used a simple function to search a weather-tracking website for information linked to the city that the user has specified.
